Tutorial of NEST-Simulator tool for spiking neural network creation. The tutorial ranges from the basic simulation of a single neuron to the design of bigger structrures of multi-neuron networks and provides an introduction to the neuroscientific analysis of the outcomes of the model.


- Tutorial 1: Creation of 1 neuron and basic concepts in creating an firing neuron model.
- Tutorial 2: Connections between 2 or more neurons. Learning using plastic synpases.
- Tutorial 3: Creation of large populated networks.
